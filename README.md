## Give everything a place

Projects, screenshots, things to read later—keep them in their own groups, arranged
the way you work. PecoFence adds just enough structure to make your desktop useful again.

| **Group your work** | **Keep folders close** | **Clear some space** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Make a fence for each project. Drag, resize and snap it into place. | Put a live folder on your desktop. Browse subfolders and see changes as they happen. | Double-click the desktop to hide your groups. Double-click again to bring them back. |

## See it in action

### One window. Multiple workspaces.

Keep related groups together as tabs. Switch from Work to Art in a click,
then drag a tab out when you want the extra room.

![Switching between Work and Art, then detaching a tab into its own fence.](docs/assets/tabs.gif)

### Your desktop, one shortcut away.

Press **Ctrl + Alt + Space** to bring your fences above the current application.
Grab what you need, then press **Esc** to return.

## Small details, better everyday use

| Experience | What you get |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Less sorting** | Rules for file types, extensions, names, wildcards, shortcut targets, time and size. New files find their group automatically. |
| **Glass that fits your desktop** | Fluent and Liquid Glass themes, light/dark modes, per-fence colors, opacity and icon tinting. |
| **Familiar file handling** | Explorer context menus, drag and drop, copy/paste, multi-select, thumbnails and icon/list/details views. |
| **Space when you need it** | Roll a fence up to its title. Hover to expand. Lock a layout you like. |
| **A way back** | Layout snapshots, daily backups, configuration import/export and display swapping. |
| **A small footprint** | A native Rust application; the WebView2 settings panel loads on demand. |

Automatic organizing rules keep files in their original locations. File moves you
initiate work like they do in Explorer.

## Get PecoFence

This is the independently maintained edition at [Tinnci/PecoFence](https://github.com/Tinnci/PecoFence).
Its Microsoft Store and winget channels are not configured, and no Releases have been published yet.
Check this repository's [Releases](https://github.com/Tinnci/PecoFence/releases) or
[CI artifacts](https://github.com/Tinnci/PecoFence/actions) for available builds, or build from source below.

1. When a portable build is available, download `pecofence-<version>-x64.zip` from this repository's Releases or CI artifacts.
2. Extract the **whole ZIP** into a folder and run `pecofence.exe`.
3. Start organizing. Right-click the tray icon whenever you need Settings or want to exit.

**Windows 11 x64 · Portable ZIP · No account required · Apache 2.0 licensed**

The first launch creates Programs, Folders, Files and documents, and Desktop groups
in your selected language. Windows desktop icons are restored when you exit.

<details>
<summary><strong>Requirements, configuration and a few useful notes</strong></summary>

- Designed for Windows 11 22H2 and later. Most native testing has been on 25H2;
  the full older-version and multi-display hardware matrix is still in progress.
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime is required for Settings. Keep the bundled
  `WebView2Loader.dll` and `pecofence-watchdog.exe` beside the app.
- Configuration lives in `%APPDATA%\PecoFence\config.json`. Launch with
  `--portable` to keep it in a `config` folder beside the executable.
- Existing installations keep their previous configuration directory.
  See the [upgrade guide](docs/UPGRADING.md).
- Glass uses the static desktop wallpaper. It does not refract other applications
  or live video wallpaper.
- Windows-owned dialogs and third-party Explorer menu entries follow Windows' language.
- Portable builds are unsigned. If Windows SmartScreen appears on first launch, choose
  **More info → Run anyway** only if you trust the build's source.

## Build it. Make it yours.

PecoFence is Apache 2.0 licensed, and contributions are welcome—from a sharper translation
to a better desktop interaction.

[Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) · [Improve a translation](docs/LOCALIZATION.md) · [Development guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from source</strong></summary>

Install Rust stable and Visual Studio Build Tools with the C++ workload and Windows SDK.
This edition also currently requires authenticated Git access to the private
`Tinnci/spm` repository; access to the public PecoFence repository alone is not sufficient.

```powershell
cargo build --locked --release
Copy-Item third_party/webview2/WebView2Loader.x64.dll target/release/WebView2Loader.dll
```

Create a distributable portable ZIP:

```powershell
./scripts/make-portable.ps1
```

The workspace is organized into `crates/` for the native app, `ui/` for Settings,
`locales/` for translations and `scripts/` for verification and packaging.
The product website lives in `site/`, and the optional video project in `extras/`
is independent of the app build.
