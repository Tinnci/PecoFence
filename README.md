## Give everything a place

Projects, screenshots, things to read later—keep them in their own groups, arranged
the way you work. PecoFence adds just enough structure to make your desktop useful again.

| **Group your work** | **Keep folders close** | **Clear some space** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Make a fence for each project. Drag, resize and snap it into place. | Put a live folder on your desktop. Browse subfolders and see changes as they happen. | Double-click the desktop to hide your groups. Double-click again to bring them back. |

## See it in action

### One window. Multiple workspaces.

Keep related groups together as tabs. Switch from Work to Art in a click,
then drag a tab out when you want the extra room.

![Switching between Work and Art, then detaching a tab into its own fence.](docs/assets/tabs.gif)

### Your desktop, one shortcut away.

Press **Ctrl + Alt + Space** to bring your fences above the current application.
Grab what you need, then press **Esc** to return.

## Small details, better everyday use

| Experience | What you get |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Less sorting** | Rules for file types, extensions, names, wildcards, shortcut targets, time and size. New files find their group automatically. |
| **Glass that fits your desktop** | Fluent and Liquid Glass themes, light/dark modes, per-fence colors, opacity and icon tinting. |
| **Familiar file handling** | Explorer context menus, drag and drop, copy/paste, multi-select, thumbnails and icon/list/details views. |
| **Space when you need it** | Roll a fence up to its title. Hover to expand. Lock a layout you like. |
| **A way back** | Layout snapshots, daily backups, configuration import/export and display swapping. |
| **Native Settings** | Settings now uses Reactor-hosted native WinUI 3 controls across five task pages, including thirteen rule-condition forms. Automated and synthetic-tour checks pass; feature parity and real-Windows accessibility, DPI and clean-machine acceptance remain pending. The selected self-contained Windows App SDK Runtime 2.5.1 adds deployment/resource cost, and the selected package excludes WebView2 pending final package verification; no size or startup improvement is claimed. |

Automatic organizing rules keep files in their original locations. File moves you
initiate work like they do in Explorer.

## Speaks your language

**English · 简体中文 · 繁體中文 · 日本語 · 한국어**  
**Deutsch · Français · Español · Português (Brasil) · Русский**

All ten translations are included and work offline. Filenames and custom names are preserved.
The native Settings language selector and localized forms are implemented; visual,
accessibility and full language/DPI acceptance remain required.

## Get PecoFence

This is the independently maintained edition at [Tinnci/PecoFence](https://github.com/Tinnci/PecoFence).
Its Microsoft Store and winget channels are not configured, and no Releases have been published yet.
Check this repository's [Releases](https://github.com/Tinnci/PecoFence/releases) or
[CI artifacts](https://github.com/Tinnci/PecoFence/actions) for available builds, or build from source below.

1. When a portable build is available, download `pecofence-<version>-x64.zip` from this repository's Releases or CI artifacts.
2. Extract the **whole ZIP** into a folder and run `pecofence.exe`.
3. Start organizing. Right-click the tray icon whenever you need Settings or want to exit.

**Windows 11 x64 · Portable ZIP · No account required · Apache 2.0 licensed**

The first launch creates Programs, Folders, Files and documents, and Desktop groups
in your selected language. Windows desktop icons are restored when you exit.

<summary><strong>Requirements, configuration and a few useful notes</strong></summary>

- Designed for Windows 11 22H2 and later. Most native testing has been on 25H2;
  the full older-version and multi-display hardware matrix is still in progress.
- Settings now uses five Reactor-hosted native WinUI 3 task pages. Headless tests and
  a synthetic WinUI tour, including close/reopen, have passed; this is not full feature
  parity or release acceptance. Keyboard/UI Automation/Narrator, high-contrast, text
  scaling, all ten languages at 100%/150%/200% DPI and clean-machine checks remain
  mandatory release-acceptance work. Package/import/process checks must still confirm
  the pinned Windows App SDK Runtime and the absence of WebView2 payload.
- The selected distributable carries Windows App SDK Runtime 2.5.1 self-contained,
  so users do not need a separate Windows App SDK runtime installation. This runtime
  increases deployment and resource cost. The Windows SDK mentioned for source builds
  is a development toolchain, not the packaged runtime. Full Windows CI enforces a
  6.5 MiB (6,815,744-byte) executable cap; final release measurements are pending.
  No startup or memory improvement is claimed.
- Keep `pecofence-watchdog.exe` beside the app for desktop-icon recovery.
- Configuration lives in `%APPDATA%\PecoFence\workspace.v2.json`. Launch with
  `--portable` to keep it in a `config` folder beside the executable.
- The new workspace format does not import or migrate old configurations.
  Existing files are retained; create a new workspace or import a supported document.
  See the [upgrade guide](docs/UPGRADING.md).
- Glass uses the static desktop wallpaper. It does not refract other applications
  or live video wallpaper.
- Windows-owned dialogs and third-party Explorer menu entries follow Windows' language.
- Portable builds are unsigned. If Windows SmartScreen appears on first launch, choose
  **More info → Run anyway** only if you trust the build's source.

## Build it. Make it yours.

PecoFence is Apache 2.0 licensed, and contributions are welcome—from a sharper translation

<summary><strong>Build from source</strong></summary>

Install Rust stable and Visual Studio Build Tools with the C++ workload and Windows SDK.
The Windows SDK is for development; released packages are intended to carry the
Windows App SDK Runtime 2.5.1 self-contained, not require users to install it separately.
Public builds use only this repository and public registries, including the local
`crates/spm-contracts` crate (0.1.0); no private token or SPM checkout is needed.
The optional `Tinnci/spm` backend remains private and is needed only for live SPM
data, not for compiling or using ordinary desktop fences. It is not distributed
with PecoFence. See the [SPM boundary](docs/SPM_BOUNDARY.md).

```powershell
cargo build --locked --release
```

Create a distributable portable ZIP:

```powershell
./scripts/make-portable.ps1
```

The workspace is organized into `crates/` for the Rust app, `locales/` for
translations and `scripts/` for verification and packaging. Settings uses
Reactor-hosted native WinUI 3, not a browser frontend. See the
[verification gates](docs/VERIFICATION_GATES.md) for source-only, Windows CI and
release-acceptance requirements.
The optional video project in `extras/` is independent of the app build.
